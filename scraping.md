    [Test-Wise Recorder](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/testwise-recorder/) – This plugin is amazing. It records your interactions with a site and spits out Ruby Watir code. It’s not 100% all of the time, but it is a damn good starting point.


    [FireXPath](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firepath/) – This lets you right click any item on the page and grab the exact XPath string to access it through code. It is super handy for a lot of these projects.
